### **🔥 AI Medical Screener – Full MVP Blueprint 🔥**  
A **minimum viable product (MVP) version** of an **AI-powered health screening app**, optimized for fast development, real-world impact, and hackathon success.  

---

## **1️⃣ Core Features (MVP Scope)**  

### **✅ AI Image Recognition (Core Feature)**  
- Users **upload an image** of a skin condition, rash, or eye issue.  
- AI model (TensorFlow Lite) **analyzes and classifies** the condition.  
- **Output:**  
  - **Possible Diagnosis (e.g., eczema, infection, irritation).**  
  - **Risk Level (Low, Moderate, High Concern).**  
  - **Basic Treatment Tips (Hydration, Creams, Doctor Visit Advice).**  

### **✅ AI Chatbot for Symptom Analysis**  
- Users describe **additional symptoms** (pain, redness, fever).  
- Chatbot **asks relevant follow-up questions** (via text input).  
- Uses **predefined logic + basic NLP** to provide advice.  

### **✅ Nearby Clinic Finder**  
- Uses **Google Maps API** to find **nearby clinics**.  
- Displays **clinic name, distance, contact info**.  
- Basic **manual appointment booking request** (user submits request form).  

### **✅ User Health Log & Secure Storage**  
- Saves **previous AI analyses & chatbot responses** for later reference.  
- Uses **SQLite (local database) or Expo SecureStore** to store data securely.
