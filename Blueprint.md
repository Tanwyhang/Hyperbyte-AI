# **🔥 Expo-Powered Hackathon App Blueprint**  

## **1. Core Principles**  
✔ **Mobile-First with Expo** – Rapid development without native dependencies.  
✔ **Simplicity & Feasibility** – Focus on a single, impactful problem.  
✔ **User-Centric Design** – Intuitive UI and smooth UX.  
✔ **Engagement & Retention** – Gamification and community features.

## **2. Tech Stack Selection (Expo-Centric Approach)**  

### **Frontend (React Native with Expo)**  
✅ **Expo (Managed Workflow)** – Easy setup, fast testing, and deployment.  
✅ **React Native Paper / MUI** – Pre-styled UI components.  
✅ **Tailwind React Native** – Utility-first styling (for consistency).  
✅ **React Navigation** – Smooth navigation with stack/tabs/drawer layouts.  
✅ **Reanimated & Gesture Handler** – Performance-optimized animations.  
✅ **React Query / Async Storage** – Efficient data caching and offline support.  

### **Backend (FastAPI + JSON-Based API)**  
✅ **FastAPI** – Lightweight, high-performance backend.  
✅ **Uvicorn** – ASGI server for handling requests.  
✅ **JSON Storage (Local-first API)** – Simple, fast data management.  
✅ **SQLite (Optional for Persistency)** – Lightweight embedded DB.  
✅ **Firebase (Optional for Authentication & Realtime Data)** – Easy auth integration.  

### **Other Essential Tools**  
✅ **Expo Go (Testing on Devices)** – Instant app previews.  
✅ **Expo EAS Build (Production Builds)** – Deploy to App Store & Play Store.  
✅ **GitHub + Expo GitHub Actions (CI/CD)** – Automate deployment.  
✅ **Vercel / Railway (Backend Hosting)** – Free-tier backend hosting.

## **3. App Structure & Development Flow**  
The app consists of **three core pillars** to fit any hackathon theme.  

| **Pillar** | **Purpose** | **Implementation** |
|------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Learn** | Provides educational content or insights. | Fetches from JSON API or Firebase Firestore. |
| **Act** | Tracks actions, habits, or progress. | Stores user logs in Async Storage or SQLite. |
| **Engage** | Allows community interaction. | (Optional) Firebase Realtime DB for chat/forums. |

### **Development Phases (Expo-Focused Time Allocation)**
**⌛ 0-3 Hours** → Ideation, Wireframing, Expo Setup  
**⌛ 3-6 Hours** → Build Core UI (Screens, Navigation, Theming)  
**⌛ 6-12 Hours** → Implement API + Data Storage (Async Storage / SQLite)  
**⌛ 12-18 Hours** → Test Core Features, Add Enhancements  
**⌛ 18-24 Hours** → Debugging, Final Polish, Presentation Prep

## **4. Backend & API Flow**
- **Data Storage:** Uses JSON for quick local reads/writes or SQLite for persistency.  
- **API Endpoints:**  
  - `GET /content` → Fetch articles, guides, or tasks.  
  - `POST /track` → Store user progress.  
  - `GET /leaderboard` → (Optional) Show community rankings.  
- **Security:** Use Firebase Auth or Expo SecureStore for authentication.
